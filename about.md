As a result of recent scientific advances, there is a tremendous  amount of biomedical research data and data available from disease  classifications, health records, clinical trials and adverse event  reports that could be useful for understanding health and disease and  for developing and identifying treatments for diseases. Ideally, these  data would be mined collectively to provide insights into the  relationship between molecular and cellular processes (the targets of  rational drug design) and the signs and symptoms of diseases. Currently, these very rich yet different data sources are housed in various  locations, often in forms that are not compatible or interoperable with  each other. All of these factors limit the ability to get more  treatments to more patients more quickly.

To address these problems, the [National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)](https://ncats.nih.gov) launched the [Biomedical Data  Translator program](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator), called *Translator* for short. This multiyear,  iterative effort will culminate in the development of a comprehensive,  relational, N-dimensional Biomedical Data Translator that integrates  multiple types of existing data sources, including objective signs and  symptoms of disease, drug effects, and intervening types of biological  data relevant to understanding pathophysiology.
