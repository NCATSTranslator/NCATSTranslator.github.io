## How to use GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/NCATSTranslator.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files. Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/NCATSTranslator.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

 [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing:

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
